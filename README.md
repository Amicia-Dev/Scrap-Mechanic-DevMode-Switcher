Sick of the hassle of diving into the game files to toggle cheat commands? I got a solution for you! Just click the 'Launch.bat,' complete the first time setup in the menu, and you're set! The Mode Switcher lets you swith between DevMode and NormalMode without any fuss! Sadly you still have to restart your game when you switch it but I can't really do anything about that.
## Installation



```text
    1. Make sure you have python installed.
    2. Download the files.
    3. Run the Launch.bat
    4. In the main menu, run First Time Setup
```
    
## Extra Info

The program only works on windows at the moment but if anyone needs a linux version, just contact me and i will try to make a linux version.
